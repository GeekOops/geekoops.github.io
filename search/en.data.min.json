The roles are written to be easily usable, tested, minimal yet configurable.\nSimplicity is key for GeekOops. Each role is aimed to be self-sufficient, without crazy and sometimes unsolvable dependency chains. Roles are in general automatically tested to ensure, that they remain functional over time.\nGeekOops was started in SUSE Hackweek 20 and continued in SUSE Hack Week 21.

This document is intended to help you to bring the most out of your new role.\nAdding a Molecule test "},{"id":2,"href":"/pages/guides/molecule/","title":"Molecule","parent":"Guides","content":"Good ansible roles test themselves using Ansible Molecule. Molecule itself provides support for testing multiple instances, i.e. OS versions. It can be integrated with GitHub Actions and provides a good way of automated testing of your new roles.\nGetting started You can take the geekoops-nginx project as a template or follow the description below.\nFor the GeekOops project, we typically use docker containers with systemd to test the roles on. Test runs can be executed on your local computer by running molecule test. Installation First, ensure molecule is installed. Although there are packages for openSUSE available, the only supported installation method is via pip\npip3 install --user -U molecule pip3 install --user -U molecule[docker] pip3 install --user molecule-containers Basic layout Inside your Ansible role, there should be a molecule folder that contains roughly the following structure\nmolecule/ â””â”€â”€ default â”œâ”€â”€ converge.yml â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile.leap15_4 â”œâ”€â”€ molecule.yml â””â”€â”€ tests â””â”€â”€ test_default.py molecule.yml is the \u0026ldquo;inventory\u0026rdquo; of the molecule test. Contains the definitions of the scenarios. Here we define, on which platforms the test runs and how the scenarios for those test runs look like.. converge.yml is the \u0026ldquo;playbook\u0026rdquo; of the molecule test. It defines how the host configuration looks like. This is the place where you can configure additional software and system configuration, if needed. Dockerfile.* - Those are the Containerfiles for creating the test system as required by the molecule.yml file. tests/test_default.py defines the testinfra tests that will test the host. Those are python scripts that will test the host after the role has been applied. How does it work? By choosing the docker driver in the molecule.yml file, the defined platforms all will be treaded as docker container, e.g.\ndriver: name: docker platforms: - name: leap15_4 image: registry.opensuse.org/opensuse/leap:15.4 dockerfile: Dockerfile.leap15_4 command: ${MOLECULE_DOCKER_COMMAND:-\u0026#34;/usr/sbin/init\u0026#34;} privileged: true cgroupns: host tmpfs: - /run - /tmp provisioner: name: ansible inventory: host_vars: leap15_4: vhosts_dir: \u0026#34;/etc/nginx/vhosts.d\u0026#34; deploy_nginx_config: true verifier: name: testinfra This means molecule will create a new container image using the provided Dockerfile Dockerfile.leap15_4. This will be the platform of the molecule test. Think of this as a virtual machine, where molecule will:\nPerform some preparation steps according to converge.yml. Apply the ansible role according to the definition in the provisioner section in the molecule.yml file. Mind the inventory section and the host_vars there. This is the inventory for the molecule test run Run the python tests defined in tests/ (e.g. test_default.py). Those are testinfra test runs that will test the host for the expected changes and functionality. I stated earlier that the converge.yml is the \u0026ldquo;playbook\u0026rdquo; of the molecule test run. This is the file where the role needs to be defined, and you can add additional tasks required for the test run. See e.g. the following convere.yml file, taken from the nginx role:\n--- - name: Converge hosts: all tasks: - name: \u0026#34;Include geekoops-nginx\u0026#34; include_role: name: \u0026#34;geekoops-nginx\u0026#34; ## Setup test enviroment # Deploy a test site and serve it - name: Deploy test page copy: content: | \u0026lt;html\u0026gt;Success! The test page is displayed correctly\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; dest: \u0026#34;{{www_dir}}/index.html\u0026#34; group: \u0026#34;{{ nginx_user }}\u0026#34; owner: \u0026#34;{{ nginx_group }}\u0026#34; mode: 0754 register: deployed Here we include the role itself, but we also need to perform additional tests like creating a test page, which aren\u0026rsquo;t part of the role. This is how you can do it as well.\nRunning the test run On your local machine, you can run a test run simply by\nmolecule test Ensure that the docker daemon is running.\nDepending on your configuration a successful test run should look something like the following:\nCongratulations! Your ansible role has been tested ðŸ˜ƒ\nAdding tests So far we only discussed how you can setup the base structure and configure the host. The second most important part are the actual tests.\nMolecule uses testinfra for testing the established environment (i.e. docker containers in this case). Testinfra is a Python framework for writing unit test for testing the state of servers and is well suited for this job.\nTests are located in the molecule/default/tests directory and are in essence simple Python scripts that verify the state of the system under test.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the following test from the nginx role:\n#!/usr/bin/python3 # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import testinfra.utils.ansible_runner import os testinfra_hosts = testinfra.utils.ansible_runner.AnsibleRunner(os.environ[\u0026#39;MOLECULE_INVENTORY_FILE\u0026#39;]).get_hosts(\u0026#39;all\u0026#39;) def test_phpinfo(host): cmd = host.run(\u0026#34;curl -v http://127.0.0.1/index.html\u0026#34;) print(cmd.stdout) assert \u0026#39;HTTP/1.1 200 OK\u0026#39; in cmd.stderr assert \u0026#34;Success\u0026#34; in cmd.stdout assert \u0026#34;The test page is displayed correctly\u0026#34; in cmd.stdout The test_phpinfo method runs curl on the test system and verifies if the output matches an expected value.\nYou can add a new test function there, e.g. def test_service:\ndef test_service(host): nginx = host.service(\u0026#34;nginx\u0026#34;) assert nginx.is_running assert nginx.is_enabled The online documentation of testinfra is a good starting point for getting an overview of the available methods and modules. The host module is the one that should cover most of the needed use cases.\nIntegration into GitHub Actions Consider the following template for running Molecule as part of the integration pipeline:\n--- name: Test deployment \u0026#39;on\u0026#39;: pull_request: push: schedule: # Run every Wednesday at 01:42 - cron: \u0026#34;42 1 * * 3\u0026#34; jobs: lint: name: Lint runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Check out codebase uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Set up Python uses: actions/setup-python@v2 with: python-version: \u0026#39;3.x\u0026#39; - name: Install dependencies run: pip3 install yamllint - name: Lint repository run: yamllint . molecule: name: Molecule runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Check out the codebase uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Set up Python uses: actions/setup-python@v2 with: python-version: \u0026#39;3.x\u0026#39; - name: Install dependencies run: pip3 install ansible molecule[docker] docker pytest testinfra - name: Run Molecule run: molecule test env: PY_COLORS: \u0026#39;1\u0026#39; ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR: \u0026#39;1\u0026#39; If you put this file into .github/workflows/CI.yml and you enable GitHub Actions on your repository, then molecule will run on every pull request and in addition once per week to ensure the role remains healthy.\nRemember that GitHub disabled Actions on \u0026ldquo;inactive\u0026rdquo; repositories after some time (currently 60 days) of inactivity, so you might need to re-enable the workflows from time to time.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/pages/","title":"Pages","parent":"GeekOops","content":""},{"id":4,"href":"/posts/20220629-collectd/","title":"Ansible collectd","parent":"Posts","content":"The geekoops-collectd role is an Ansible role to install and configure collectd on an openSUSE Leap server.

This post acts as a tutorial to start with the first role of this project: Installing and configuring a nginx webserver via the geekoops-nginx role.\nTutorial Let\u0026rsquo;s assume we want to roll this role out on our imaginary jellyfish server. We need to have root ssh access to jellyfish. Ansible also supports sudo, but this is not covered here. So first make sure you can do the following\n# Make sure you can login into our imaginary test server as root! ssh root@jellyfish All of the next steps will take place in a temporary directory. I in general keep all my ansible stuff in a dedicated ansible folder in my home directory, for this tutorial we are going to use a empty new folder, as you might want to dump everything afterwards.\n# For this tutorial we start in a virgin new folder mkdir jellyfish-sandbox cd jellyfish-sandbox Now, clone the geekoops-nginx role\ngit clone https://github.com/GeekOops/geekoops-nginx Ansible operates with so-called Playbooks. Playbooks are a yaml file that tell ansible what to do. Roughly it consists of a definition of which hosts ansible should operate on and what to do there. For this example we are going to use the following playbook, which you store as jellyfish.yml:\n--- # Example playbook for nginx on jellyfish - hosts: jellyfish user: root roles: - role: geekoops-nginx vars: setup_default_page: true default_page_hostname: \u0026quot;{{ansible_host}}\u0026quot; config_firewall: true firewall_zone: \u0026quot;public\u0026quot; Last thing is to create a custom inventory. Although you might have put jellyfish into your ~/.ssh/config already, ansible needs also to know that this is a host for it. For that we create a file called inventory with this simple line:\njellyfish Ok, when you have done that, then we\u0026rsquo;re ready to rock. Run ansible-playbook with the inventory and the playbook:\nansible-playbook -i inventory jellyfish.yml Ansible now runs the playbook, nginx will be installed and the firewall will open the http (80) and https (443) port for you on the \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; zone.\nDone!\n"},{"id":12,"href":"/posts/20210326-example-webserver/","title":"Example: Webserver (nginx+php-fpm)","parent":"Posts","content":"In this post we are going to setup our example jellyfish host to run nginx and php-fpm.

First ensure you have ansible installed on your host machine\nsudo zypper in ansible Then, we need a working directory, let\u0026rsquo;s say jellyfish.\nmkdir jellyfish cd jellyfish All next steps should be run in this directory.\nWe first setup a JeOS VM as our playing ground. Skip down to the Running the playbook section in case you have already your VM up and running and just want the playbook to run.\nReady in under 5 minutes: openSUSE JeOS No installation required! This VM image is ready in under 5 minutes.\nThe most easy way of just getting a openSUSE Leap VM running, is to use the JeOS image. JeOS (or MinimalVM) is a slimmed down image that contains just enough to run as a VM. It boots directly from the provided qcow2 image and does not need to be installed. A handful of configuration steps in the first-run wizard and you\u0026rsquo;re good to go! You have your openSUSE Leap VM up and running in under 5 minutes. JeOS can be downloaded from https://get.opensuse.org/leap in Alternative Downloads\u0026quot;. Download the KVM and XEN image, import it into your virt-manager and we\u0026rsquo;re ready to go.\nJeOS VM: Step-by-step guide Back in our jellyfish directory, we first download the VM image (which is also our hard disk)\n$ wget -O jeos-openSUSE-Leap-15_4.qcow2 https://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/15.4/appliances/openSUSE-Leap-15.4-JeOS.x86_64-kvm-and-xen.qcow2 Create a qcow2 overlay, so that multiple machines could in principle use the same qcow2 image as base and we only store the overlay in a separate image file:\nqemu-img create -b jeos-openSUSE-Leap-15_4.qcow2 -f qcow2 -F qcow2 jellyfish.qcow2 30G Then we run virt-install to setup and run our jellyfish server:\n$ virt-install --name=jellyfish --file=$PWD/jellyfish.qcow2 --vcpus=2 --ram=2048 --os-variant=opensuse15.4 --boot hd After a handful of configuration steps, you have a functional system in just some minutes.\nAs you can see in this gif, it only took me 1:30 minutes to get a functional openSUSE Leap 15.4 system using the JeOS image.\nProvide ssh access for ansible Ansible requies ssh access to the machines it is expected to provision. In this example we will assign the jellyfish hostname to the VM IP address via /etc/hosts. In a more mature environment you might need to update the DHCP server but that\u0026rsquo;s outside of the scope of this tutorial.\nFirst we need to find out the IP address of the VM. For that, we log in via the virt-manager console, then run ip address (or ip a in short) to list the currently assigned IP addresses. See the 192.168.122.116 in the output below:\n# ip a 1: lo: \u0026lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000 link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00 inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 ::1/128 scope host valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever 2: eth0: \u0026lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP\u0026gt; mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000 link/ether 52:54:00:85:0f:7a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff inet 192.168.122.116/24 brd 192.168.122.255 scope global eth0 valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever inet6 fe80::5054:ff:fe85:f7a/64 scope link valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever Now, as root on your local machine, add the IP address to /etc/hosts otherwise you will need to replace jellyfish by the ip address in all following commands. We have been adding the last line 192.168.122.116 jellyfish to your /etc/hosts file.\nvim /etc/hosts # IP-Address Full-Qualified-Hostname Short-Hostname # 127.0.0.1\tlocalhost # special IPv6 addresses ::1 localhost ipv6-localhost ipv6-loopback fe00::0 ipv6-localnet ff00::0 ipv6-mcastprefix ff02::1 ipv6-allnodes ff02::2 ipv6-allrouters ff02::3 ipv6-allhosts ::1 hotdog [...] # This is what we add here to assign an IP our amazing jellyfish VM 192.168.122.116 jellyfish Now let\u0026rsquo;s copy the ssh-key from your host via\nssh-copy-id root@jellyfish Done. Check if you can login via ssh root@jellyfish. Now would be a good time to power off your VM and create a VM snapshot, so in case something goes wrong in the next step you have your \u0026ldquo;saved game\u0026rdquo; slot you can always rollback to.\nRemember to remove the jellyfish from /etc/hosts afterwards, in case you don\u0026rsquo;t want to keep your jellyfish :-)\nRunning the playbook First ensure (one more time), that you have root access to jellyfish\nssh root@jellyfish Back in our jellyfish directory, we need to get the roles and the playbook:\n# Download the ansible repositories git clone https://github.com/GeekOops/geekoops-nginx git clone https://github.com/GeekOops/geekoops-php-fpm # Download playbook curl -o jellyfish.yml https://geekoops.github.io/posts/20210326-example-webserver/jellyfish.yml Next we need to create an inventory. And inventory is a list of hosts or host groups that belongs to a certain deployment. In our basic setup we only hold the jellyfish host, but you can see this really as an inventory of all servers that you would manage via ansible. Let\u0026rsquo;s stay simple here:\n# Create inventory echo \u0026quot;jellyfish\u0026quot; \u0026gt; inventory We now have all ingredients that we need. We have the playbook, we have the roles and we have the inventory. So from here nothing is holding us back, let\u0026rsquo;s fire ansible up and run the playbook using ansible-playbook:\nansible-playbook -i inventory jellyfish.yml # Use the custom inventory instead of the default (/etc/ansible) Go grab something to drink and let ansible sparkle it\u0026rsquo;s magical fairy dust. When you return the playbook has hopefully setup your machines to the desired state:\nWhat you hope for is to see something like the following after about 1-2 minutes of ansible running:\nThe ok=22 changed=17 failed=0 tells you that ansible was successful.\nNow in your browser navigate to http://jellyfish/phpinfo.php and you should see, the output of phpinfo:\nCongratulations. You have successfully deployed a nginx + php-fpm webserver instance.

Among others here are some of the most important ones:\nValue Description Default configure_php_ini Configrue the php.ini file true configure_php_fpm Configure php-fpm configuration files true enable_php_fpm Enable php-fpm service true apcu_enable Enable the APCu cache false apcu_shm_size APCu cache size 32M php_memlimit PHP memory limit 128M php_uploads Enable PHP uploads On php_maxuploadsize Max upload size 256M php_maxuploads Max uploads in a request 20 Example This role installs only php-fpm. It works best together with the nginx role, but you can also use it as a standalone:\n--- - hosts: jellyfish user: root roles: - role: geekoops-php-fpm vars: apcu_enable: true apcu_shm_size: 32M php_memlimit: 256M php_maxuploadsize: 64M A more extended example of this role together with nginx can be found in the Example Webserver post.\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/posts/20210326-nginx/","title":"Ansible nginx","parent":"Posts","content":"The geekoops-nginx role is a simple Ansible role to install and setup nginx on a openSUSE Leap server.
